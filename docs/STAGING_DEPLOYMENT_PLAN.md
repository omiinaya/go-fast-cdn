# Staging Deployment Plan for Unified Media Repository

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive deployment plan for deploying the unified media repository to the staging environment. This is the fifth step in Phase 5 of the unification project and serves as a final test before deploying to production.

## Deployment Goals

1. Deploy the unified media repository to the staging environment
2. Ensure the staging environment is properly configured
3. Execute database migration steps for the staging environment
4. Deploy both backend and frontend components
5. Verify the deployment was successful
6. Ensure backward compatibility is maintained

## Prerequisites

Before starting the deployment, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Staging Environment Access**: Access to the staging environment servers and infrastructure
2. **Database Access**: Credentials and access to the staging database
3. **Backup System**: Verify that the backup system is working correctly
4. **Source Code**: Latest version of the source code is available
5. **Dependencies**: All required dependencies are installed and configured
6. **Monitoring**: Monitoring and logging systems are in place

## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Preparation

1. **Create a Full Backup**
   - Execute database backup using the existing backup system
   - Verify backup integrity
   - Store backup in a secure location

2. **Verify Staging Environment Configuration**
   - Check server resources (CPU, memory, disk space)
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Confirm environment variables and configuration files
   - Check database connection and permissions

3. **Prepare Deployment Artifacts**
   - Build the application binaries
   - Package frontend assets
   - Prepare configuration files for staging environment
   - Create deployment manifest

### Phase 2: Database Migration

1. **Execute Media Unification Migration**
   - Run the staging migration script with backup creation
   - Monitor migration progress
   - Verify migration completion

2. **Verify Migration Results**
   - Run the verification script to ensure data integrity
   - Check that all records have been migrated correctly
   - Verify that the unified media repository is functioning

3. **Test Rollback Procedure**
   - Perform a test rollback to ensure the rollback process works
   - Re-run the migration after the test rollback
   - Verify the system is back to the expected state

### Phase 3: Backend Deployment

1. **Stop Current Application**
   - Gracefully stop the running application
   - Verify all processes have been terminated

2. **Deploy New Backend**
   - Copy new application binaries to the staging server
   - Update configuration files
   - Set correct permissions and ownership

3. **Start Backend Application**
   - Start the application with the new unified media repository
   - Monitor startup logs for any errors
   - Verify the application is running correctly

### Phase 4: Frontend Deployment

1. **Build Frontend Assets**
   - Compile and bundle the frontend code
   - Optimize assets for staging environment
   - Generate versioned asset files

2. **Deploy Frontend Assets**
   - Copy new frontend assets to the staging server
   - Update asset references in the application
   - Clear any cached assets

3. **Verify Frontend Functionality**
   - Test all frontend components
   - Verify API connectivity
   - Check media upload and download functionality

### Phase 5: Post-Deployment Verification

1. **System Integration Testing**
   - Test all system components working together
   - Verify media upload, storage, and retrieval
   - Test backward compatibility with existing APIs

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Run performance tests to ensure system meets requirements
   - Monitor resource usage during tests
   - Compare with baseline performance metrics

3. **Security Testing**
   - Verify security measures are in place
   - Test authentication and authorization
   - Check for any security vulnerabilities

4. **User Acceptance Testing**
   - Perform end-to-end testing of key user workflows
   - Verify the unified media repository meets user requirements
   - Document any issues or concerns

## Rollback Plan

If any issues are encountered during the deployment, the following rollback steps should be executed:

1. **Immediate Rollback Triggers**
   - Critical system errors
   - Data corruption or loss
   - Performance degradation beyond acceptable limits
   - Security vulnerabilities

2. **Rollback Procedure**
   - Stop the application
   - Restore database from pre-deployment backup
   - Revert to previous application version
   - Restart the application
   - Verify system is functioning correctly

3. **Rollback Verification**
   - Run verification scripts to ensure system integrity
   - Test critical functionality
   - Confirm data consistency

## Deployment Scripts

The deployment will be automated using the following scripts:

1. **Linux/macOS**: `scripts/deploy_to_staging.sh`
2. **Windows**: `scripts/deploy_to_staging.bat`

These scripts will automate the entire deployment process, including:
- Pre-deployment checks
- Database backup
- Migration execution
- Application deployment
- Verification steps
- Rollback if needed

## Success Criteria

The deployment will be considered successful if:

1. All deployment steps complete without errors
2. The unified media repository is functioning correctly
3. All existing functionality continues to work (backward compatibility)
4. Performance metrics meet or exceed requirements
5. Security measures are in place and functioning
6. All verification tests pass

## Timeline and Schedule

The deployment is planned to be executed during the following timeline:

- **Pre-Deployment Preparation**: 1 hour
- **Database Migration**: 2 hours
- **Backend Deployment**: 1 hour
- **Frontend Deployment**: 1 hour
- **Post-Deployment Verification**: 2 hours
- **Total Estimated Time**: 7 hours

The deployment will be scheduled during a maintenance window to minimize impact on users.

## Roles and Responsibilities

1. **Deployment Lead**: Oversees the entire deployment process
2. **Database Administrator**: Handles database migration and backup
3. **System Administrator**: Manages server configuration and application deployment
4. **QA Engineer**: Performs verification and testing
5. **Development Team**: Provides support and resolves any technical issues

## Communication Plan

1. **Pre-Deployment Notification**: Notify all stakeholders 24 hours before deployment
2. **Deployment Status Updates**: Provide regular updates during the deployment process
3. **Post-Deployment Summary**: Share deployment results and any issues encountered

## Risk Assessment

1. **Data Loss Risk**: Mitigated by comprehensive backup and verified rollback procedures
2. **Downtime Risk**: Minimized by efficient deployment process and clear rollback plan
3. **Compatibility Issues**: Addressed by thorough testing and verification
4. **Performance Degradation**: Monitored with performance testing and metrics

## Post-Deployment Activities

1. **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring for the first 24 hours after deployment
2. **Issue Resolution**: Prompt resolution of any issues that arise
3. **Documentation**: Update deployment documentation with lessons learned
4. **Production Deployment Planning**: Use staging deployment results to plan production deployment

## Conclusion

This deployment plan provides a comprehensive approach to deploying the unified media repository to the staging environment. By following this plan, we can ensure a successful deployment that serves as a final test before deploying to production.
