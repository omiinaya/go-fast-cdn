# Media Migration Test Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive test suite for the media migration functionality. This test suite simulates a staging environment by creating a separate test database, populating it with sample data, running the migration, verifying the results, testing rollback functionality, and cleaning up.

## Files Created

### 1. Test Implementation
- **`cmd/test_media_migration/main.go`** - Main test script implementation
  - Creates a test database in `db_data_test/` directory
  - Populates it with 3 sample images and 3 sample documents
  - Runs the media migration script
  - Verifies that all data was migrated correctly
  - Tests the rollback functionality
  - Cleans up the test database

### 2. Execution Scripts
- **`scripts/test_media_migration.sh`** - Shell script for Linux/macOS
- **`scripts/test_media_migration.bat`** - Batch script for Windows
  - Both scripts provide easy execution of the test suite
  - Support a `--cleanup-only` flag for manual cleanup

### 3. Documentation
- **`docs/TEST_MEDIA_MIGRATION.md`** - Detailed testing guide
  - Step-by-step instructions for running the tests
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Explanation of what each test step verifies

### 4. Code Fixes
- **`src/models/mediaModel.go`** - Fixed ID conflict issue
  - Modified `MediaFromImage` and `MediaFromDoc` functions to not copy the ID field
  - This prevents primary key conflicts when migrating images and documents with the same ID

## How to Run the Tests

### Linux/macOS
```bash
# Make the script executable (one-time setup)
chmod +x scripts/test_media_migration.sh

# Run the full test suite
./scripts/test_media_migration.sh

# Clean up without running tests (if needed)
./scripts/test_media_migration.sh --cleanup-only
```

### Windows
```cmd
# Run the full test suite
scripts\test_media_migration.bat

# Clean up without running tests (if needed)
scripts\test_media_migration.bat --cleanup-only
```

### Direct Go Command
```bash
# Run the full test suite
go run cmd/test_media_migration/main.go

# Clean up only
go run cmd/test_media_migration/main.go --cleanup-only
```

## Test Process

The test script performs the following steps:

1. **Database Setup**
   - Creates a test database in `db_data_test/test.db`
   - Initializes it with the required tables (images, docs, config)

2. **Sample Data Population**
   - Creates 3 sample image records with unique filenames and checksums
   - Creates 3 sample document records with unique filenames and checksums

3. **Migration Execution**
   - Runs the media migration script
   - Merges images and docs tables into a unified media table
   - Marks the migration as completed

4. **Migration Verification**
   - Verifies that the media table was created
   - Checks that all 6 records (3 images + 3 documents) were migrated
   - Ensures checksums are preserved during migration
   - Confirms that the migration record was created

5. **Rollback Testing**
   - Executes the rollback functionality
   - Verifies that the media table is dropped
   - Confirms that the migration record is removed
   - Ensures original tables and data are preserved

6. **Cleanup**
   - Removes the test database directory
   - Closes database connections properly

## Expected Output

```
Starting Media Migration Test Suite
====================================

Step 1: Setting up test database...
✓ Test database set up successfully

Step 2: Populating with sample data...
✓ Created 3 sample images and 3 sample documents

Step 3: Running media migration...
✓ Media migration completed successfully

Step 4: Verifying migration...
✓ Migration verified successfully: 3 images + 3 documents = 6 media records

Step 5: Testing rollback...
✓ Rollback verified successfully: 3 images and 3 documents preserved

Step 6: Cleaning up test database...
✓ Test database cleaned up successfully

All tests passed successfully!
```

## Key Issues Resolved

### ID Conflict Problem
The original implementation had a critical issue where both images and documents with the same ID would cause a primary key conflict in the media table. This was resolved by:

1. Modifying the `MediaFromImage` and `MediaFromDoc` functions in `src/models/mediaModel.go`
2. Removing the ID field from the copied model data
3. Letting GORM automatically generate new IDs for the media records

### Test Environment Isolation
The test script creates a completely separate database to ensure:
- No interference with the production database
- No leftover data after test completion
- Repeatable test runs

## Next Steps

1. **Run the test suite** to verify everything works correctly
2. **Review the output** to ensure all steps pass
3. **Consider additional test cases** if needed:
   - Test with larger datasets
   - Test with edge cases (empty tables, very large files, etc.)
   - Test with different file types
4. **Deploy to staging** once all tests pass
5. **Monitor the actual migration** when run on staging data

## Customization Options

The test script can be easily customized:

1. **Sample Data**: Modify the `populateSampleData()` function to create different test data
2. **Test Count**: Adjust the number of sample records as needed
3. **Database Location**: Change the `TestDbFolder` and `TestDbName` constants
4. **Additional Verifications**: Add more checks in the `verifyMigration()` function

## Conclusion

The test suite provides a comprehensive way to verify that the media migration script works correctly before deploying it to the staging environment. It tests all critical aspects of the migration including data integrity, rollback functionality, and cleanup procedures.
