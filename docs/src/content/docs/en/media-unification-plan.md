# Media Unification Implementation Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

### Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive plan for implementing a unified media repository that will consolidate the existing separate image and document management systems into a single, cohesive platform. The unification will streamline operations, improve maintainability, and provide a consistent user experience across all media types.

### Expected Timeline and Resources
- **Total Estimated Duration**: 6-8 weeks
- **Backend Development**: 3-4 weeks
- **Frontend Development**: 2-3 weeks
- **Testing and Deployment**: 1-2 weeks
- **Required Resources**:
  - 2 Backend Developers (Go)
  - 1 Frontend Developer (React/TypeScript)
  - 1 QA Engineer
  - DevOps support for deployment

### Key Milestones
1. **Week 1-2**: Backend Preparation and Database Migration
2. **Week 3-4**: Backend Implementation
3. **Week 5-6**: Frontend Implementation
4. **Week 7-8**: Testing and Deployment

## 2. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Backend Preparation
This phase focuses on preparing the backend infrastructure for the unified media system. We'll create the foundational models, database operations, and API designs that will support all media types.

### Phase 2: Database Migration
In this phase, we'll migrate the existing separate image and document tables into a unified media table while preserving all existing data and relationships.

### Phase 3: Backend Implementation
This phase involves implementing the actual backend functionality for the unified media system, including handlers, routes, and utility functions.

### Phase 4: Frontend Implementation
Here, we'll update the frontend to work with the unified media system, creating consistent components and services for handling all media types.

### Phase 5: Testing and Deployment
The final phase focuses on comprehensive testing and deploying the unified media system to production with appropriate monitoring.
